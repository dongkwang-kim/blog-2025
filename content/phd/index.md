I collect helpful advice for PhD students here. Although there are already many nice github repositories that do something similar, I want to make it more personalized with annotation. I will absorb and internalize the principles from the collection of advice and hope this could help you as well.

### Principles for a PhD Program (By Prof. Seong Joon Oh) [[Link](https://github.com/coallaoh/Principles)]
* The repo includes [a well-written guideline for PhD students](https://github.com/coallaoh/Principles/tree/main/principles/phd). Since it is composed by a (rather young) professor, it reflects his viewpoints as an academic advisor at early stage, while being appropriate for the PhD students in **this** era as he also had gone through the PhD program recently. I used the guideline to setup my own PhD milestones.
