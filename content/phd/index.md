I've gathered a collection of valuable advice for PhD students here. While many excellent GitHub repositories offer simliar compilations, my aim is to provide a more personalized perspective with annotations. This is my own interpretation of advice -- I wish to absorb and internalize the core principles from the collection of advice and hope this could help you as well.

### Principles for Research and PhD Program (By [Prof. Seong Joon Oh](https://coallaoh.github.io/)) [[Link](https://github.com/coallaoh/Principles)]
* The repository features [a well-structured guideline for PhD students](https://github.com/coallaoh/Principles/tree/main/principles/phd). As it is authored by a (relatively young) professor, it offers a contemporary advice from an academic advisor who has recently navigated the PhD program themselves. This makes it particularly relevant for PhD students in **this era**, and I've personally leveraged this guideline to establish my own PhD milestones.
* I was also drawn to the research strategy outlined [here](https://github.com/coallaoh/Principles/tree/main/principles/research). It proposes to start with an easy problem setup and find a simple solution. Then, by relaxing an assumption or restricting resources, challenges are introduced. Finding a solution under this circumstance enables a smooth transition into a more difficult problem setup. The key is to **always stay close to perfect performance**.
